# GitHub

## Introduction

Triangular comes with GitHub Access so you can get the latest up to date code directly from the triangular repository.

You will need to make sure you have Git installed on your system to get access to the repo see the [install git](docs.html#install-git) section of the docs for how to do this.

## Create a GitHub Account

If you don't already have a GitHub account you can [create one here](https://github.com/join)

## Request an invite

Once you have a GitHub username you can request an invite to the repo by filling in [this simple form](http://triangular.oxygenna.com/#/github) on the demo site.

You will then recieve an email from GitHub confirming your invite.
