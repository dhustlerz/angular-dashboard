# Introduction

## Overview

First of all thank you for purchasing triangular.

{{theme.name}} is a fantastic admin template build with angularjs.  It has been created with merticulous attention to [Google's material design specification](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html).

Using our experience at developing AngularJS admin templates for clients, we have tried to make an admin template that will be easy to plug in to an existing API.

We hope you will enjoy using this triangular to make wonderful things.

## Technologies

Triangular is built on top of a few fantastic technologies.  These are AngularJs and Angular Material, both were created by Google.  Triangular also uses the material design specification in its design and functionality.

### Material Design

Material design is a design language developed by Google and announced at the Google I/O conference on June 25, 2014. Expanding upon the "card" motifs first seen in Google Now, it is a design with increased use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows. Designer Matías Duarte explained that "unlike real paper, our digital material can expand and reform intelligently. Material has physical surfaces and edges. Seams and shadows provide meaning about what you can touch." Google states that their new design language is based on paper and ink.

At Google we say, “Focus on the user and all else will follow.” We embrace that principle in our design by seeking to build experiences that surprise and enlighten our users in equal measure. This site is for exploring how we go about it. You can read our design guidelines, download assets and resources, meet our team, and learn about job and training opportunities.

Here are some resources about Material Design

- [Google Design](http://www.google.com/design/)
- [Material Design Guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)

### AngularJS

AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.

Angular is what HTML would have been, had it been designed for applications. HTML is a great declarative language for static documents. It does not contain much in the way of creating applications, and as a result building web applications is an exercise in what do I have to do to trick the browser into doing what I want?

Before you get started with the template it is recommended that you learn about AngularJS.  Here are a few articles and videos that will help you get up to speed.

- [New to angular?](https://egghead.io/articles/new-to-angularjs-start-learning-here)
- [AngularJS in 5min (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnXO-i7944M)
- [AngularJS Fundementals in 60min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM)
- [Official Docs Guide](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide)

### Yeoman Gulp Angular Generator

At the start of this project we used the [Yeoman generator for AngularJS with GulpJS](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular) to generate the gulp tasks and structure of the app.  This is a good place to look if you are looking to do extra build processes with the template.

### Angular Material

For developers using AngularJS, Angular Material is both a UI Component framework and a reference implementation of Google's Material Design Specification. This project provides a set of reusable, well-tested, and accessible UI components based on Material Design.

- [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/#/)


### John Papa's Angular Style Guide

Triangulars code follows the [John Pappa style guide for angular](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).  This is an opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions and structuring of angular apps that is now endorsed by the Google angular team.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

In this section we will show you how to install all the prerequisites you need on your system to run triangular.

Here is a handy install checklist for you to go through.  Instructions on how to install them are below the table.

| Prerequisite                      | Description                                                            |
|:----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) | Javascript runtime needed to build the app                             |
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/)       | Source Control for bower installation & access latest code from GitHub |
| [Bower](http://bower.io/)         | Package Installer used to grab dependencies needed in the app          |
| [GulpJs](http://gulpjs.com/)      | Automation system for building the app                                 |

### Install Node.js

We recommend installing the latest version of node.

You can download the latest of node.js [from here](https://nodejs.org/download/) alternatively there are [guides on how to install using a package manager](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager).

Once you have installed node you can check that it is working correctly by opening a command prompt / terminal and typing

    node --version

and see something like this

    $ node --version
    4.4.5

### Install Git

You will also need to install the Git source control system on your machine.  Check out [this guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on how to install on Windows, Mac and Linux.

### Install Bower

Bower is a package manager built with nodejs so you will need to have installed nodejs before attempting to install bower.

To install bower just type the following command into your terminal.

    npm -g install bower

This tells node's package manager (npm) to install bower on your system.  The <code>-g</code> tells npm to install this package globally, this means that you can use this command in any folder on your system.

### Install GulpJS

GulpJS automates building and testing your app.  It is also built with nodejs so you will need to have installed nodejs before attempting to install.

To install gulp just type the following command into your terminal.

    npm -g install gulp-cli

This tells node's package manager (npm) to install gulp-cli on your system.  The <code>-g</code> tells npm to install this package globally, this means that you can use this command in any folder on your system.

## Downloading

Now you have all the prerequisites installed on your system the next step is to grab the latest copy of triangular from themeforest.

So first of all you will need to log in to your [themeforest account](http://themeforest.net).

After that goto your downloads page

![ThemeForest Downloads Page](assets/images/getting-started/tf-download.png)

From there locate the {{theme.name}} template click the **download button** and then select **All files & documentation**

![ThemeForest Downloads Page](assets/images/getting-started/tf-downloads.png)

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  Congratulations.  You now have a shiny new copy of {{theme.name}}
</div>

### Unzipping the download

You should now have a file that looks something like this.

<code>themeforest-11711437-triangular-material-design-admin-template-angularjs.zip</code>

In order to get at the goodness inside you will need to [unzip this file](https://answers.stanford.edu/solution/how-do-i-zip-and-unzip-files-and-folders-do-i-need-winzip-or-stuffit).

### Zip Contents

Once you have unzipped the {{theme.name}} zip file you will find the following folders have been created.

| Folder / File | Contents                                                         |
|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| changelog.md  | lists changes to each version of the template                    |
| source/       | contains the templates source files                              |
| demo/         | compiled version of source files (minified version of demo site) |
| docs/         | the documentation you are reading now                            |
| extras/       | lots of extra material design & code goodies                     |

The source folder contains all the templates source code files.

The demo folder contains a built version of the source files, this is an exact copy of the demo site that is running on {{theme.name}}'s ThemeForest demo site.

The docs folder contains a copy of the latest documentation for {{theme.name}}, there is also an online copy available.

The extras folder contains lots of material design graphics and a copy of the {{theme.name}} PHP API that provides the dummy content for the demo.

# The source code

## Where is the code

Once you have [downloaded and unzipped](#downloading) the main template download zip.

You will find several folders have been created, one of which will be a folder called source.

This is where you will find all the code for triangular.

## Folder and file structure

Inside the source folder you will see a folder structure like this:

| Folder / File      | Contents                                                         |

## Module structure

Each module in {{theme.name}} uses John Papa's recommended structure and naming conventions.

To find out how this structure works we will describe the seed-module module's structure below.

| Folder / File           | Contents                                                |

| seed-page.controller.js | Example Controller for the seed-page.tmpl.html page     |
| seed-page.tmpl.html     | Example page HTML                                       |
| seed-page.tmpl.scss     | Example page SCSS for CSS styling                       |
| seed.module.js          | Seed module js file                                     |
| seed.config.js          | Sets up the modules routes and adds menus to triangular |

# Developing

## Setup development server

Hopefully now you have [Installed the prerequisites](#prerequisites) and have read about [the file and folder structure](#folder-and-file-structure).

So let's start coding.

There are two command you need to run from inside the triangular source folder (the main root directory of the source folder that contains gulpfile.js).

These two commands will install the js packages needed to run the development server and create production builds.

### How to video

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xr5htuXU914?list=PLjEWC37YdOvuqtra-Ayen42ekMLuEELEi" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


### Install node modules

Run the following command from the root of your source files to install the node modules listed in packages.json

    npm install

### Install bower packages

Run the following command from the root of your source files to install the bower packages listed in bower.json

    bower install

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>Note</strong> - You will need [git installed](#install-git) for bower to work.
</div>


## Starting development server

Once you have all the [node packages](#install-node-modules) & [bower packages]((#install-node-modules)) installed all ready to go you can start developing.

To do this you just need to start a local development server, from the root of the source folder run this command.

    gulp serve

This should automatically open up a browser window with the template running.

## Modifying the code

Once the development server is up and running any changes you make to the HTML & JS & SASS files will trigger your browser window to auto refresh with your changed code.

You can read about how the templates modules are structured [here](#folder-and-file-structure)

Take a look at all the example codes included with the template you can find them in the <code>app/examples/</code> folder.

All the code for the triangular module is contained inside the <code>app/triangular/</code> folder.  It is best to not modify this code as this code will be updated over time.

If you need to be able to change anything inside triangular and can not do so programatically from inside your app.  Please create an issue in our GitHub repo.

# Customizing triangular

## General

### Changing the logo

The super easy way to change the template logo is to replace this file.

    src/assets/images/logo.png

With your own logo.  This will replace the logo used throughout the theme (Logo above sidebar, loading animations, etc)

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    Note - Use the same image size as the template for the best results.
</div>

If you want to change the image filename used for the template logo edit the following line in <code>config.triangular.settings.js</code>

```javascript
triSettingsProvider.setLogo('assets/images/logo.png');
```

### Changing the app name

To change the name that is shown in the logo bar at the top of the sidemenu & loading animation just edit the following line in <code>config.triangular.settings.js</code>

```javascript
triSettingsProvider.setName('triangular');
```

### Changing the browser title

Triangular will create the title for each page using site title & the breadcrumbs on the page all separated by a separator character.

Triangular creates the following title

    site title + separator + breadcrumb + separator + breadcrumb

So for example if you have your site title set to <code>My App</code> and your separator set to <code>|</code> and you were in Elements -> Buttons page your title would be.

    My App | Elements | Buttons

To set the title and the separator edit the following code on <code>config.triangular.settings.js</code>

```javascript
triRouteProvider.setTitle('Triangular');
triRouteProvider.setSeparator('|');
```

## Toolbar

### Where is the top toolbar code

You can find the code for the toolbar in the following folder.

    app/layouts/toolbar

You are free to modify this code to suit your needs.

Inside the folder you will find the following files.

| Folder / File         | Contents                                          |
|:----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| toolbar.controller.js | Toolbar Controller for the toolbar.tmpl.html page |
| toolbar.tmpl.html     | Toolbar HTML                                      |
| toolbar.tmpl.scss     | Toolbar SCSS for CSS styling                      |

### Overiding the toolbar files

If you want triangular to use a different HTML file or controller to the ones in <code>app/layouts/toolbar</code> you can override them in the <code>config.triangular.layout.js</code> file.

You can change both the html file and the controller used in the toolbar by changing the following code.

```javascript
// top toolbar HTML and controller
triLayoutProvider.setDefaultOption('toolbarTemplateUrl', 'app/layouts/toolbar/toolbar.tmpl.html');
triLayoutProvider.setDefaultOption('toolbarController', 'ToolbarController');
```

### Toolbar Settings

The toolbar has a few built in settings that you can change by editing the <code>config.triangular.layout.js</code> file.

- toolbarSize: can be set to *default | md-medium-tall | md-tall*
- toolbarShrink: can be set to *true | false*
- toolbarClass: can be set to any class name you need

You can play around with these settings on the [Layout Composer page](http://triangular.oxygenna.com/#/layouts/composer) of the demo.


## Left Side Menu

### Customizing the side menu

Triangular comes with both a service and a provider for setting the items in the sidemenu this allows you to set menus during the config stage or at runtime.

- **triMenuProvider** - Allows you to set your menu items at the config stage of angularjs.
- **triMenu** - This service allows you to change your sidemenu at runtime in controllers.

### Adding a menu to the sidebar

To add a menu to the sidebar you just need to create a module config and inject the triMenuProvider.

For example create a file called myapp.config.js in your app folder.

**myapp.config.js**
```javascript
(function() {
    'use strict';

    angular
        .module('app')
        .config(routeConfig);

    /* @ngInject */
    function routeConfig($stateProvider, triMenuProvider) {

        // first create a state that your menu will point to .
        $stateProvider
        .state('triangular.admin-default.my-page', {
            url: '/my-page',
            templateUrl: 'app/my-page.tmpl.html'
        });

        // next add the menu item that points to the above state.
        triMenuProvider.addMenu({
            name: 'Parent Menu',
            icon: 'zmdi zmdi-calendar-check',
            type: 'dropdown',
            priority: 1,
            children: [{
                name: 'My Page',
                type: 'link',
                state: 'triangular.admin-default.my-page'
            }]
        });
    }
})();
```

The code above will make state using UI Router and then add a menu item that will point to that states page.

### Modifying a menu at runtime

In order to modify a menu at runtime you can also inject the triMenu service.

Take the following controller example.

```javascript
(function() {
    'use strict';

    angular
        .module('app')
        .controller('MenuController', MenuController);

    /* @ngInject */
    function MenuController(triMenu) {
        var vm = this;

        ////////////////

        function toggleExtraMenu(showMenu) {
            // add a menu to the sidebar
            triMenu.addMenu({
                name: 'MENU.MENU.DYNAMIC-MENU',
                icon: 'zmdi zmdi-flower-alt',
                type: 'link',
                priority: 0.0,
                state: 'triangular.admin-default.menu-dynamic-dummy-page'
            });

            // remove a menu from the sidebar
            triMenu.removeMenu('triangular.admin-default.menu-dynamic-dummy-page');
        }
    }
})();
```

The above code will add and remove a menu item from the main menu.

### Side Menu Layout Settings

The side menu has a few built in settings that you can change by editing the <code>config.triangular.layout.js</code> file.

- sideMenuSize: can be set to *off | hidden | icon | full*

You can play around with these settings on the [Layout Composer page](http://triangular.oxygenna.com/#/layouts/composer) of the demo.

### Where is the left sidenav code

You can find the code for the left sidenav in the following folder.

    app/layouts/leftsidenav

You are free to modify this code to suit your needs.

Inside the folder you will find the following files.

| Folder / File             | Contents                                      |

### Overiding the left side menu files

If you want triangular to use a different HTML file or controller to the ones in <code>app/layouts/leftsidenav</code> you can override them in the <code>config.triangular.layout.js</code> file.

You can change both the html file and the controller used in the toolbar by changing the following code.

```javascript
// left sidemenu HTML and controller
triLayoutProvider.setDefaultOption('sidebarLeftTemplateUrl', 'app/layouts/leftsidenav/leftsidenav.tmpl.html');
triLayoutProvider.setDefaultOption('sidebarLeftController', 'LeftSidenavController');
```

# Colors

## Overview

Angular Material already comes with a system for handling themes and palettes.

You can [read about them here ](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/Theming/01_introduction)

### Where is the theme code

You can find all the theme config code discussed below in the app theme config file.

  app/config.triangular.themes.js


## Palettes

A palette is a collection of hues you can use pre configured material design palettes or create your own.

Once you have decided on / created your color scheme you can then use palettes to create a [theme](#themes).

### Material palettes

The following color palettes are built into angular material.

- red
- pink
- purple
- deep-purple
- indigo
- blue
- light-blue
- cyan
- teal
- green
- light-green
- lime
- yellow
- amber
- orange
- deep-orange
- brown
- grey
- blue-grey

### Creating a palette

If you don't want to use the palettes provided by material design, you can also create your own.  Just add a config function that injects the <code>$mdThemeingProvide</code> and define the colors you want to use.

```javascript
(function() {
    'use strict';

    angular
        .module('app')
        .config(themesConfig);

    /* @ngInject */
    function themesConfig ($mdThemingProvider) {
        $mdThemingProvider.definePalette('amazingPaletteName', {
            '50': 'ffebee',
            '100': 'ffcdd2',
            '200': 'ef9a9a',
            '300': 'e57373',
            '400': 'ef5350',
            '500': 'f44336',
            '600': 'e53935',
            '700': 'd32f2f',
            '800': 'c62828',
            '900': 'b71c1c',
            'A100': 'ff8a80',
            'A200': 'ff5252',
            'A400': 'ff1744',
            'A700': 'd50000',
            'contrastDefaultColor': 'light',    // whether, by default, text (contrast)
                                                // on this palette should be dark or light
            'contrastDarkColors': ['50', '100', //hues which contrast should be 'dark' by default
             '200', '300', '400', 'A100'],
            'contrastLightColors': undefined    // could also specify this if default was 'dark'
        });
    }
});
```

## Themes

Material Angular has a provider that allows you to create themes called <code>mdThemingProvider</code> however with triangular we created our own theme provider <code>triThemingProvider</code>.

Triangular's theme provider copies exactly the functionality provided by the [mdThemingProvider](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/Theming/03_configuring_a_theme) but allows us to dynamically load themes which saves on the amount of extra CSS created by the template

### Create a theme

First of all you will need to create some themes to use to color the template areas.

You can do this using the <code>triThemingProvider</code> to assign palettes.

Material Angular comes with several material design palettes built in.  You can view the [palettes available here](http://triangular.oxygenna.com/#/ui/colors).

```javascript
triThemingProvider.theme('cyan')
.primaryPalette('cyan')
.accentPalette('amber')
.warnPalette('deep-orange');
```

The line above creates a theme called "cyan" which sets the primary palette to cyan and the accent and warn palettes to amber and deep-orange.

Next we can make a 2nd theme to go with the cyan theme.

```javascript
triThemingProvider.theme('white-cyan')
.primaryPalette('white')
.accentPalette('cyan', {
  'default': '500'
})
.warnPalette('deep-orange');
```
This theme has white as its primary palette and cyan as its accent palette.

Once you have created a theme you can use it to [create a skin](#skins) for your app.

## Skins

Triangular has the ability to assign themes to different parts of the template.

![Cyan Skin](assets/images/customisation/skin-preview.png)

There are 4 areas of the template that you can assign themes to.

- Sidebar: *the main left menu sidebar.*
- Toolbar: *the top toolbar of the page.*
- Logo: *the logo at the top of the Sidebar (top left of the page).*
- Content: *the content area where your pages are shown.*

You can see [an example of this on the skins page](http://triangular.oxygenna.com/#/ui/skins).

### Create a skin

Now that we have some themes to play with we can assign them to the areas of the template.

We can do this using the <code>triSkinsProvider</code>.

```javascript
triSkinsProvider.skin('cyan-cloud', 'Cyan Cloud')
.sidebarTheme('cyan')
.toolbarTheme('white-cyan')
.logoTheme('cyan')
.contentTheme('cyan');
```

So above we have created a theme called Cyan Cloud that uses the two themes we created in [the previous steps](#create-a-theme).

The sidebar and logo are using cyan and the toolbar and content areas are using white-cyan

### Pre made skins

The following skins were created for triangular.

- cyan-cloud
- red-dwarf
- plumb-purple
- dark-knight
- battleship-grey
- zesty-orange
- indigo-island
- kermit-green


### Set the default skin

{{theme.name}} comes with many beautiful themes.

You can [view and try them all here](http://triangular.oxygenna.com/#/ui/skins).

To change the default skin is super easy.

Just edit config.triangular.themes.js and change this line to a skin you would like to load.

```javascript
triSkinsProvider.setSkin('cyan-cloud');
```

Change this to any of the provided skin names

- cyan-cloud
- red-dwarf
- plumb-purple
- dark-knight
- battleship-grey
- zesty-orange
- indigo-island
- kermit-green

For example to change to the Plumb Purple theme you would change to.

```javascript
defaultSkin: 'plumb-purple'
```

### Disable demo skin selection

By default the template allows users to select a skin that is then stored in a cookie.

If you want to disable this just edit config.triangular.themes.js and remove the following line.

```javascript
triSkinsProvider.useSkinCookie(true);
```

# Translations

## Set your application languages

{{theme.name}} uses [Angular Translate](https://angular-translate.github.io/) to translate strings in the template.

Angular translate has [great documentation](http://angular-translate.github.io/docs/#/guide) as well as an [API guide](http://angular-translate.github.io/docs/#/api).

In order to set the languages that your app supports you just need to edit the translate module config file at <code>app/translate/translate.config.js</code>

At the top of the config file is this code.

```javascript
var appLanguages = [{
    name: 'Chinese',
    key: 'zh'
},{
    name: 'English',
    key: 'en'
},{
    name: 'French',
    key: 'fr'
},{
    name: 'Portuguese',
    key: 'pt'
}];
```

This sets out the name and keys of the language that your app will support.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    **Note** - The key you set here will determine the names of the translation files that are loaded.  e.g. <code>key: fr</code> will make the app load <code>app/i18n/fr.json</code>
</div>


## How to translate a page

In order to translate some text in a page just use the translate directive in your HTML.

for example

```html
<h1 translate>Settings</h1>
```

Then edit or create a json translation file in your app/i18n folder.

So for example to translate to French we would create a new file called <code>fr.json</code> in the <code>app/i18n</code> folder and add the following json.

```javascript
{
    "Settings": "Paramètres",
}
```

You will then see that your Settings text is translated into Paramètres.

## How to translate a menu item

Each menu item is filtered with the translate filter.  So just make sure that the name you use for your menu is translated in your i18n json files.

For example in <code>app/examples/charts/charts.config.js</code> you will find the following code.

```javascript
triMenuProvider.addMenu({
    name: 'Charts',
    icon: 'zmdi zmdi-chart',
    type: 'dropdown',
    priority: 5.1,
    ...
});
```

So for example to translate to French we should have translation in our <code>i18n/fr.json</code> file that looks like this.

```javascript
{
    "Charts": "Graphiques",
}
```

Then the menu item will use Graphiques for it's name.

## Auto translating all template strings

We have built in an auto translater into triangular that sends all the strings in your i18n folders to Yandex to be translated.

It then writes translation files in your chosen language.

First of all to use this you will need to [get a Yandex API Key](https://tech.yandex.com/translate/).

Once you have a key edit this file

    app/gulp/translate.js

At the top of the file you will see this code

```javascript
// ADD YOUR YANDEX API KEY HERE
// go here for more info
// https://tech.yandex.com/translate/
var YANDEX_API_KEY = '';
```

edit the YANDEX_API_KEY and add your api key

```javascript
var YANDEX_API_KEY = '1234567894621695846516546951651981';
```

Once this is done, open up a terminal and cd to your app directory.

From there you can run the gulp task that will translate the template translation files.

You need to specify 2 languages e.g.

```bash
    gulp translate --from en --to fr
```

The command above will grab all en.json files from all your i18n folders send them to Yandex to be translated into French.

Once this is done the resulting translations will be written to fr.json files in each coresponding i18n folder.

## Using modular translations

Out of the box triangular puts all the translations strings of the app into one file in the <code>app/i18n</code> folder.

But it is also possible to separate all the translations into your angularjs modules.

To do this just create a new folder inside your module with the name i18n and add your translation files into there.

So for example to make the examples/chart module take care of its own translations you would create the following folder <code>app/examples/chart/i18n</code> and then add your translation json files inside there.

After that the last thing to do is tell angular translate to look in that folder when it is looking for translations.  Edit <code>app/translate/translate.config.js</code> and add the following code.

```javascript
$translatePartialLoaderProvider.addPart('app/examples/chart');
```

Adding this tells angular translate to also look in your newly created folder.

## How to turn off translations

Out of the box triangular is multi-language, but we realise this might not be for everyone.
So we have made turning off multi-language is very simple.

Edit the app module file <code>app/app.module.js</code> and comment out or remove this line

```javascript
'app.translate',
```

This will stop the app translate module from being loaded and therefore stop all translation functionality.


# Typography

## Font Demo

{{theme.name}} comes with some pre defined fonts that you can try out.

Goto the demo site to [take a look](http://triangular.oxygenna.com/#/ui/typography).

## Setting default font

Changing the font that is used by triangular is very easy.

First of all choose a font from [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) (we reccommend using a font with 300,400,500 and 700 weights available).

Once you have a font you would like to use edit <code>index.html</code> and edit the contents of the head tag.

You will see a section of code like this.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=RobotoDraft:300,400,500,700,400italic">
```

Google Fonts wil tell you the correct code to replace this with when you choose to use a font from the [Google Fonts Site](http://www.google.com/fonts).

Once you have replaced this link tag with the one suggested by Google Fonts, edit the <code>/app/src/app.scss</code> file and change the following line to use your new font family.

```css
button, select, html, textarea, input {
  font-family: RobotoDraft, Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
}
```

# CSS

## SCSS

The CSS for {{theme.name}} is generated [using Sass ](http://sass-lang.com/).

You can find the Sass code in the following places

| Folder / File                  | Contents                                                            |
|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| src/app.scss                   | The main app sass file                                              |
| src/triangular/triangular.scss | Contains all the css needed for the triangular module do not modify |

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    **Note** - The gulp build will automatically compile any scss files added to the src folder or subfolders.  The resulting CSS will be minified and added to the app.css file.
</div>

Also each module imports its own scss files.

For example the elements module has its own scss file here.

    app/examples/elements/elements.module.scss

## Flexible Box Model

{{theme.name}} & Angular Material use the flexible box model to layout elements on the page.

You can read all about how the flex box model is implemented in the layout section of the [Angular Material Docs](https://material.angularjs.org).

## Helper Classes

We have provided some helper CSS classes to help easily create pages.

### Page helpers

| CSS Class                        | Description                                          |

| <code>padded-content-page</code> | Adds default padding to a page                       |

### Margin helpers

| CSS Class                                           | Description                                                                        |
|:----------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <code>margin-normal</code>                          | Adds the default 16px margin to all sides.                                         |
| <code>margin-(0-200 in steps of 10)</code>          | Adds a margin all around the element, in steps of 10. e.g. margin-10               |
| <code>margin-(top/bottom/left/right)-(0-200)</code> | Adds a margin to a specific side of an element, in steps of 10. e.g. margin-top-50 |

### Padding helpers

| <code>padding-(top/bottom/left/right)-(0-200)</code> | Adds padding to a specific side of an element, in steps of 10. e.g. padding-top-70 |

### Display helpers

| CSS Class                    | Description                                      |

| <code>overlay-(0-100)</code> | Adds dark overlay to container                   |


## CSS autoprefixer

The gulp automatically adds browser prefixes to your CSS using [gulp-autoprefixer](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-autoprefixer).

To configure this just edit

    app/gulp/styles.js

You can select which browsers you want to have compatibility with on this line.

    .pipe($.autoprefixer({browsers: ['> 1%', 'last 2 versions', 'Firefox ESR', 'Opera 12.1']}))

By default triangular is compatible with the last 2 versions of evergreen browsers as well as Firefox ESR and Opera 12.1


# Deploying

Once you have used the [development server](#starting-development-server) to modify the app to your needs you will want to get your new app online for everyone to see.

Triangular has a build system that will grab all the JS, HTML & SASS you have created whilst developing and collating it all together into a minimal package of HTML, CSS & JS files that you can the upload and deploy on your web server.

## Running a production build

Once you are happy with your site you can initiate a build that will create a copy of the template that you can FTP to your web server.

Just run the command

    gulp build

This will initiate a build, once it has finished you will find a new folder has been created called <code>dist</code>.  This is where the built files have been created, you will find the following files.

| Folder / File     | Contents                                           |
|:------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| app/              | Example data files and example source code         |
| assets/images/    | Images used in the app                             |
| fonts/            | Font icon files                                    |
| scripts/app.js    | Minified App AngularJS code                        |
| scripts/vendor.js | Minified JS packages (jquery, angularjs, etc)      |
| styles/app.css    | Minified app css                                   |
| styles/vendor.css | Minified packages css (font-awesome, chartjs, etc) |
| 401.tmpl.html     | 401 page html                                      |
| 404.tmpl.html     | 404 page html                                      |
| 500.tmpl.html     | 500 page html                                      |
| favicon.png       | App FavIcon                                        |
| index.html        | Main index.html page                               |

## Testing a production build

If you need to troubleshoot the production build process there is also an option to run the production build in the development server.

Just run the command

    gulp serve:dist

The local server that runs will now be running a built version of your site as if you ran <code>gulp build</code>

# Updating

## Updating triangular module

As updates are released to triangular you should follow these steps to update your app when a new version of triangular is released.

1. [Download the new version of triangular](download.html).
2. Compare the bower.json file in your app with the new version (check to see if angular & angular-material versions have changed)
3. If any versions have changed update your bower.json file to match
4. Copy the triangular folder from the new version into your app folder
5. Run your dev server and test your app

## Updating triangular bower

If you are using the bower version of triangular then updating should be super easy.  Just change the version number in your <code>bower.json</code> file and then run <code>bower install</code>

# Adding triangular to existing app

## Installing triangular via bower

We had lots of requests for this from people who have existing codebases and want to add triangular to their project and also keep it up to date.

The process is quite simple, run the following command in your project folder

```bash
bower install https://github.com/oxygenna/triangular-bower.git --save-dev
```

or if you have [SSH Certificates](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) set up on GitHub

```bash
bower install git@github.com:oxygenna/triangular-bower.git --save-dev
```

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Note - You will need to have [requested access to our GitHub repos](http://triangular.oxygenna.com/#/github) to do this
</div>

This will install triangular as a bower package and also all of it's dependencies.

We have created an [example app](#bower-seed-app) that is included in the main download zip that demonstrates how triangular can work using bower.

## Adding triangular to your project

You will have to do 2 things to get triangular runnning in your existing project

1. Load the triangular CSS and the extra packages CSS
2. Load the triangular Javascript and the extra packages Javascript

The code for these two steps are provided below.

We have created an example app that uses bower to run triangular, it can be found in the main download zip inside the <code>extras/triangular-seed/</code> folder.

## App Modules

- **triangular** - The triangular core module located in the triangular/ folder
- **app.examples** - All the example modules that you see in the demo site

## Creating your own module

In order to make creating a module for your work as easy as possible we have created a simple seed module to get started.

You can find the code in <code>app/seed-module</code>. The seed module is not active by default, you will have to uncomment the line of code that includes it as a dependency in <code>app/app.module.js</code>

To create your own module just make a copy of this folder and rename it to your new module name.

After that rename the module to your new module name and then add it to the dependencies in app.module.js

## Removing a module

Removing a module is super easy just edit the dependencies loaded in app/examples/examples.module.js

```javascript
(function() {
    'use strict';

    angular
        .module('app.examples', [
            'app.examples.authentication',
            'app.examples.calendar',
            'app.examples.charts',
            'app.examples.dashboards',
            'app.examples.elements',
            'app.examples.email',
            'app.examples.extras',
            'app.examples.forms',
            'app.examples.github',
            'app.examples.introduction',
            'app.examples.layouts',
            'app.examples.maps',
            'app.examples.menulevels',
            'app.examples.todo',
            'app.examples.ui'
        ]);
})();
```

For example if you wanted to remove the authentication pages (login, forgot password, etc) you would want to remove the triangular authentication package.

So you would remove this line

```javascript
'app.examples.authentication',
```

This will stop the example authentication module in the authentication folder from being loaded and remove the menu and pages.

# Directives

## paletteBackground

This directive sets the background and contrast text color of an element to a [palette hue](http://triangular.oxygenna.com/#/ui/colors).

![Color Hue](assets/images/triangular/color-hue.png)

For example to color a div using the blue 500 hue you would just use the following HTML

```html
    <div palette-background="blue:500">
        Look ma the divs blue 500!
    </div>
```

## themeBackground

This directive sets the background and contrast text color of an element to a [theme hue](http://triangular.oxygenna.com/#/ui/colors).

For example to color a div using the cyan themes accent hue-1 color you would just use the following HTML

```html
    <div md-theme="cyan" theme-background="accent:hue-1">
        Look ma the divs cyan accent hue-1!
    </div>
```

## countupto

This directive is used in the analytics dashboard widgets to trigger a counting animation.

For example to animate a counter from 0 to 101 with no decimals you would use the following.

    <p countupto="101" decimals="0"></p>

Available options can be sent to the directive using an options attribute.

Full list of options are [listed here](http://inorganik.github.io/countUp.js/).

# Advanced

## Visual Studio

For users that want to use Visual Studio to develop their app [this guide explains how to get Gulp working together with VS](http://www.davepaquette.com/archive/2014/10/08/how-to-use-gulp-in-visual-studio.aspx)


## Enable angular html5 mode

This can be achieved with connect-modrewrite


- First install connect-modrewrite
        $ npm install --save-dev connect-modrewrite

- Then edit gulp/server.js

        var modRewrite = require('connect-modrewrite');

        function browserSyncInit(baseDir, files, browser) {
          browser = browser === undefined ? 'default' : browser;

          browserSync.instance = browserSync.init(files, {
            startPath: '/index.html',
            server: {
              baseDir: baseDir,
              middleware: [
                proxyMiddleware,
                modRewrite([
                  '!\\.\\w+$ /index.html [L]'
                ])
              ]
            },
            browser: browser
          });

        }

# API Servers

## Demo API code

You can find a copy of the PHP API created to demo triangular in the main download zip file in the <code>extras/triangular-api</code>

Or follow the guide below on how to make your own.

## Creating your own API server

We will use the popular [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/) php framework to set up a simple server. The server will allow cross-origin requests, in order to allow our app to contact it even if they reside on different domains.

- Create a folder named api at the root of your web server directory in your localhost.
- Download the slim framework from [here](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/releases) in zip format. At the time of writing this guide, the current framework version is 3.5.0.
- Extract the downloaded archive and copy the folder named Slim that you will find, inside your api folder that you created in step 1.
- Create two files inside your api folder: index.php and .htaccess
- Paste the following in the index.php:

```php
<?php
require 'Slim/Slim.php';

 \Slim\Slim::registerAutoloader();

$app = new \Slim\Slim();

$app->map('/', function() use($app) {
	$response = $app->response();

    $response->header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    $response->header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST , OPTIONS');
    $response->header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Cache-Control, Pragma, accept, x-requested-with, origin, content-type, x-xsrf-token');

    $data = array('Harris' => 'programmer', 'Chris' => 'CEO');
    echo json_encode($data);
})->via('GET', 'POST');

$app->run();
```

- Paste the following in the .htaccess file:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
```

### Testing the Server
If you did everything right, you should see the following when you visit localhost/api in your browser :

```javascript
{"Harris":"programmer","Chris":"CEO"}
```

This is hardcoded sample data in json format that the endpoint returns once you visit the above url. In a production environment you will ofcourse want this data to be fetched from a database that your server will connect to.

If you have curl installed, you can also try this:

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1/api/
```

which will render something like the following :

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.6.3
Date: Tue, 07 Jul 2015 11:24:41 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.11
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: accept, origin, content-type

{"Harris":"programmer","Chris":"CEO"}
```
### Contacting the Server through Angular
Having confirmed that our simple test server is up and running, and is allowing CORS, all we have to do is use the angular $http service to contact it. In any controller inject the $http service and do the following:

```javascript
$http({
    method: 'POST',
    url: 'http://localhost/api/',
    headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8'
    },
    data: {
        test: 'test'
    }
})
.success(function(res) {
    console.log(res)
})
.error(function(err) {
    console.log(err)
});
```

If you have your browser console open you will see the response data rendered there once the endpoint responds. Changing the method to GET will make the service fire a GET request instead.

### Further information
For more information regarding slim, and guides on how to set up multiple routes in your server you can read the readme in the Slim github repository [here](https://github.com/codeguy/Slim).


# Extras

## Material Avatars

In the material-avatars folder you will find our set of material avatars, over 1400 material style avatars.

The images are divided into 2 folders men and women each containing subfolders for each face type.

Or if you have the skills you can always grab the MaterialAvatars.ai file and edit it yourself in Adobe Illustrator.

## Material Font

In the material-font folder you will find our set of material font characters.

We have provided a full alphabet and number set of images.

Or if you prefer you can always open the material-font.ai in Adobe Illustrator and modify the font as you like.

## PSD files

In the PSD folder you will find the PSD design file for the {{theme.name}} template.

## Triangular API

To make sure that {{theme.name}} is API ready we created a test API in PHP to call.

This is what provides the dummy data that is used on the Email and Example pages.

We have included it here in case anyone wants a start on creating their own API.

# Migration

## Changes in 2.7.0

Version 2.7.0 introduced a few new changes to the app.

### Optional translations

All translation code has been moved into one module so that users can turn off translations if they want to.

If you want to continue to use translations inside your app after you have updated make sure your app includes the app.translate module in your <code>app.module.js</code> file.

```javascript
(function() {
    'use strict';

    angular
        .module('app', [
            'ui.router', 'permission',
            'triangular',
            'ngAnimate', 'ngCookies', 'ngSanitize', 'ngMessages', 'ngMaterial',
            'googlechart', 'chart.js', 'linkify', 'ui.calendar', 'angularMoment', 'textAngular', 'uiGmapgoogle-maps', 'hljs', 'md.data.table', angularDragula(angular), 'ngFileUpload',
            // 'seed-module'
            // uncomment above to activate the example seed module
            'app.translate',
            // only need one language?  if you want to turn off translations
            // comment out or remove the 'app.translate', line above
            'app.permission',
            // dont need permissions?  if you want to turn off permissions
            // comment out or remove the 'app.permission', line above
            // also remove 'permission' from the first line of dependencies
            // https://github.com/Narzerus/angular-permission see here for why
            'app.examples'
        ]);
})();
```

### New simpler ui routes

For all versions < 2.7.0 you used the <code>triangular.admin-default</code> abstract routes to create pages in triangular.

```javascript
$stateProvider
.state('triangular.admin-default.forms-inputs', {
    url: '/forms/inputs',
    templateUrl: 'app/examples/forms/inputs.tmpl.html'
})
```

From 2.7.0 onwards this route has been changed to <code>triangular</code>

```javascript
$stateProvider
.state('triangular.forms-inputs', {
    url: '/forms/inputs',
    templateUrl: 'app/examples/forms/inputs.tmpl.html'
);
```

To update do a find and replace for <code>'triangular.admin-default.</code> to <code>'triangular.</code>

## Changes in 2.0.0

The main changes for version 2.0 were as follows

- Code style changes to match [John Papas style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide)
- Move triangular into it's own module to allow better intergration with new & existing apps
- Moved from jshint to eslint with eslint-angular plugin
- Changed the names of triangular routes and simplified creating pages
- Changed menu provider
- Added profiler to test speed of your AngularJS code

We realise that these changes will involve some refactoring of existing projects, but as this template is relatively new at the moment we felt this was the best time to refactor.

Moving on this will make the triangular template a lot easier to intergrate with apps and provide a more robust coding standard.

### Code style changes

These changes should not effect your app in any way other than to make the code even more readable and easier to debug.  Please read [John Papas style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) to get an idea of the style.

### Module Folder Changes

Triangular's code has now been moved into it's own module called 'triangular'

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-5">
        <h4>Old folder structure</h4>
        <img src="assets/images/triangular/migration-old-folders.png" alt="Old Folder Structure">

### Module Config Changes

The main changes that will effect your existing modules will be the changes to the module config.  Mainly the renaming of the UI Router abstract states and the refactoring of the menu provider.

To move modules over to Triangular 2.0 you will need to change 2 things

- Route names
- Side menu setup

The code is very similar to triangular 1.0 so it should be easy to transition modules over see our [Full Example](#full-example) for more detail

### UI Router name changes

We have renamed some of the routes in triangular as follows

| Old Route             | New Route                          |
|:----------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| admin-panel.default   | triangular.admin-default           |
| admin-panel-no-scroll | triangular.admin-default-no-scroll |


### Example Route

Old Route Config

```javascript
.state('admin-panel.default.maps-demos', {
    url: '/maps/demos',
    templateUrl: 'app/maps/maps-demo.tmpl.html',
});
```
New Route Config

```javascript
.state('triangular.admin-default.maps-demos', {
    url: '/maps/demos',
    templateUrl: 'app/examples/maps/maps-demo.tmpl.html'
});
```

### Menu Provider

Angular 2.0 uses the a new provider to add menu items to your side menu and you no longer have to create your menus in a module .run function.

Previous setup

```javascript
.run(function(SideMenu) {
    SideMenu.addMenu({
        name: 'MENU.MAPS.MAPS',
        icon: 'icon-place',
        type: 'dropdown',
        priority: 7.1,
        children: [{
            name: 'MENU.MAPS.FULLWIDTH',
            state: 'admin-panel.default.maps-fullwidth',
            type: 'link',
        },{
            name: 'MENU.MAPS.DEMOS',
            state: 'admin-panel.default.maps-demos',
            type: 'link',
        }]
    });
});
```

New Setup (in a module .config not .run)

```javascript
.config(function(triMenuProvider) {
    triMenuProvider.addMenu({
        name: 'MENU.MAPS.MAPS',
        icon: 'icon-place',
        type: 'dropdown',
        priority: 7.1,
        children: [{
            name: 'MENU.MAPS.FULLWIDTH',
            state: 'triangular.admin-default.maps-fullwidth',
            type: 'link'
        },{
            name: 'MENU.MAPS.DEMOS',
            state: 'triangular.admin-default.maps-demos',
            type: 'link'
        }]
    });
});
```

### Full Example

Here is an example of how the routing and menus have changed

Old config

```javascript
'use strict';

/**
 * @ngdoc module
 * @name triAngularMaps
 * @description
 *
 * The triAngularMaps module adds some map example pages
 */
angular.module('triAngularMaps', [])
.config(function ($translatePartialLoaderProvider, $stateProvider, uiGmapGoogleMapApiProvider) {
    $translatePartialLoaderProvider.addPart('app/maps');

    $stateProvider
